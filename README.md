# What is Bizthon NFT VR Explorer?
This is a proof of concept for exploring your owned NFT in a 3D environment. Just connect your wallet and see your NFTs appear automatically in your own 3D gallery! The app is also compatible with VR headsets allowing you to truly experience your NFTs like a real gallery.

Go to https://bizthon-nft-vr-explorer.pages.dev/ and wait a 30-60 seconds for the 3D scene to load. 
Then connect you wallet. Note that the app is only compatible with the **Goerli Testnet** for now. Make sure you have NFTs in your wallet on the Goerli network.

The app will fetch your NFT using the [Alchemi API for NFTs](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-get-all-nfts-owned-by-an-address) and parse the images to insert them in the 3D gallery.
